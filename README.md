# cetem-publico

European Portuguese corpus of news from the newspaper PÃºblico, with 180 million words tagged with PALAVRAS.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install cetem-publico
```

This will download this module, but it won't download the corpus file,
and it will fail if you try to use it. Use the
[cp.download](#cpdownload) method to download the corpus file
(12GB).

```js
const CETEMPublico = require('cetem-publico').CETEMPublico;
const cp = new CETEMPublico();

// cp.download(); // to download the corpus file

async function procLines(){
  for await (const line of cp.lines()){
    // do something with line
  }
}

async function procTokens(){
  for await (const token of cp.tokens()){
    // do something with token
  }
}

async function procSentences(){
  for await (const sent of cp.sentences()){
    // do something with sent
  }
}

async function procParagraphs(){
  for await (const par of cp.paragraphs()){
    // do something with par
  }
}

async function procExtracts(){
  for await (const ext of cp.extracts()){
    // do something with ext
  }
}

```

## Methods

### new CETEMPublico(file)
### new CETEMPublico(opts)
### new CETEMPublico(file, opts)

* `file`: a string containing the path to a local CETEMPublico file. If not provided, the file will be loaded from `$HOME/.cetem-publico/CETEMPublicoAnotado2019.gz`.
* `opts`: see [Options](#options-todo).

### cp.download()

Download a copy of the CETEMPublico corpus from
https://www.linguateca.pt/CETEMPublico/download/, compresses it using
Gzip and stores it in
`$HOME/.cetem-publico/CETEMPublicoAnotado2019.gz`. If file already
exists, it print a warning message and does nothing.

The whole file is 12GB, so this takes some time.

Returns a `Promise`.

### cp.lines(opts)

Returns an `AsyncGenerator` object where each item is a string
containing a line of the original corpus file.

### cp.tokens(opts)

Returns an `AsyncGenerator` object where each item is a Token object
containing one token from the original corpus file.

### cp.sentences(opts)

Returns an `AsyncGenerator` object where each item is a Sentence
object containing a sentence (`<s>` tag) of the original corpus file.

### cp.paragraphs(opts)

Returns an `AsyncGenerator` object where each item is a Paragraph
object containing a paragraph (`<p> tag)` of the original corpus file.

### cp.extracts(opts)

Returns an `AsyncGenerator` object where each item is an Extract
object containing an extract (`<ext>` tag) of the original corpus file.

## Options (TODO)

* `noMWEs`: Ignore multi-word expressions: return their tokens as any
  other token.
* `noTitles`: Omit titles
* `noAuthors`: Omit authors
* `noTitles`: Omit titles

## Classes

### Token
Used to represent the tokens in the original corpus file. In the
format used by CETEMPublico, each token is in an individual line.

#### `new Token(word, info)`

* `word` is the word in the original corpus text
* `info` (all these are optional)
    * `lineNum`: the line number for this token in the original corpus
      file
    * `tokenId`: an ID for this token
    * `section`: the ID of the section the token is in
    * `week`:
    * `lemma`: the lemmatized version of `word`
    * `pos`: the part-of-speech (POS) tag for `word`
    * `other*: an object with all the extra information found in
      CETEMPublico for this token

### MultiWordExpression

CETEMPublico annotates some mult-word expressions using `<mwe>` tags.
Inside each tag, the tokens which compose the expression, one in each
line. MWEs can have attributes indicating the lemma and the POS tag
for the whole expression.

#### `new MultiWordExpression({lemma, pos}, tokens)`

* `lemma`: the lemma for the multi-word expression
* `pos`: the POS tag for the multi-word expression
* `tokens`: an array of Token objects which make this MWE

### Sentence

In CETEMPublico, a sentence is represented using a `<s>` tag.
Sentences contain a list of tokens (the words in that sentence).
Because some words can form multi-word expressions, inside a
`Sentence` we can find both `Token`s and `MultiWordExpression`s
(which, in turn, have `Token` objects inside).

#### `new Sentence(id, tokens)`

* `id`: an id for the sentence
* `tokens`: an array of tokens and MWEs which form this sentence

### Paragraph
A paragraph, represented in CETEMPublico using the tag `<p>`.
Paragraphs are composed of a sequence of sentences.

#### `new Paragraph(id, sentences)`

* `id`: an id for the sentence
* `sentences`: an array of sentences which form this paragraph

### Extract

An extract of an news article. Extracts are represented by the tag
`<ext>` and contain a sequence of sentences. Optionally, they can also
include a Title and Authors, and the attributes `n` (an id for the
extract), `sec` (the newspaper section it was gathered from) and `sem`
(the week in which it was published).

#### `new Extract({n, sec, sem}, contents)`

* `n`: the number of this extract
* `section`: the section in which the extract was found
* `week`: the week it was published on
* `contents`: an array of Paragraph objects, possibly also including a
  Title and an Authors objects

### Authors

The authors of the article an Extract was gathered from.

#### `new Authors(tokens)`

* `tokens`: an array of `Token` objects, each being an author of the
  article

### Title

The title of the article the Extract belongs to.

#### `new Title(tokens)`

* `tokens`: an array of `Token` objects which make the title

## TODO

* Implement `opts`
* Speed up download using `fast-request`?
* ...
